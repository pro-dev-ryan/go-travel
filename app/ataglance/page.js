          Lakshadweep is the tiniest Union Territory of India and is its only
          coral island chain. The islands have a total area of 32 sq.kms and the
          lagoons enclosed by the atolls cover an area of 4200 sq.kms. Its
          territorial waters extend to 20,000 sq.kms and Exclusive Economic Zone
          (EEZ) to 4,00,000 sq.kms. Only 10 of these islands namely, Agatti,
          Amini, Andrott, Bitra, Chetlat, Kadmat, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Kiltan and
          Minicoy are inhabited. Kavaratti is the Administrative Headquarters of
          the Union Territory. It is culturally very close to the nearest
          mainland Indian state of Kerala and Malayalam is a widely spoken
          language apart from local dialects. Minocy Island has a different
          language by the name Mahl.

          Early history of Lakshadweep is unwritten. Local traditions attribute
          the first settlement on these islands to the period of Cheraman
          Perumal, the legendary king of Kerala. Though it is commonly believed
          that the first settlers in these islands were the ship-wrecked sailor
          who had set out to Mecca in search of Cheraman Perumal, the legendary
          king of Kerala, studies are being continued about the settlement.

          Earlier, life in these Islands was hard and challenging. Foreign
          traders and travellers held sway in these islands to explore itâ€™s
          natural beauty. Quite often the islanders were subject to their savage
          cruelties. The events in these geographically isolated islands were
          never known to the outside world.
